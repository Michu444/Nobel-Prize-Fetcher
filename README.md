## NOBEL PEOPLE FETCHER SCRIPT



I assume that the computer on which the script will be executed has Python 3 installed
(and in case of any issues running the script on Windows, the path to the Python
interpreter is set in the environment variables).

The script can be run using one of the available scripts, depending on the operating system used:

- Windows: windows_run.bat
- Linux: linux_run.sh

> Running the script using one of the provided scripts will install the required library, "requests,"
> if it's not already available, and then execute the script.
